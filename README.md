# COVID-19 Contact Tracing Model

 <font size="4"> This code creates an app to implement a simple model for COVID-19 contact tracing, described in detail in [this paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.05.20091280v1.full.pdf).  You can see the structure of the model in the picture below.  Infected individuals generate new infections based on whether they have symptoms, whether disease is detected, and whether they have been identified as a contact of an infected individual. You can view the live app [here](https://alyssab.shinyapps.io/spark_control/).
